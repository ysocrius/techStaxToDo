   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gansh_todo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

   ```

### Supabase Setup Steps

1. Create a Supabase account at [https://supabase.com/](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Set up database tables:
   - Create a `tasks` table with the following columns:
     - `id` (uuid, primary key)
     - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
     - `title` (text)
     - `is_completed` (boolean, default: false)
     - `created_at` (timestamp with time zone, default: now())

4. Set up Row Level Security (RLS):
   - Enable RLS on the `tasks` table
   - Create policies for:
     - SELECT: Allow users to read their own tasks
     - INSERT: Allow users to create their own tasks
     - UPDATE: Allow users to update their own tasks
     - DELETE: Allow users to delete their own tasks

5. Enable Email Authentication:
   - Go to Authentication > Providers
   - Enable Email provider
   - Customize settings as needed

6. Update the Supabase URL and anonymous key in the app:
   - Find these values in your Supabase project dashboard
   - Update them in `lib/services/supabase_service.dart`

## Hot Reload vs Hot Restart

### Hot Reload

**Hot Reload** allows you to inject updated source code into the running Dart VM. It updates the UI almost instantly without losing the current state of the app.

**When to use:**
- Making UI changes
- Adding new widgets
- Updating methods or functionalities that don't affect the current state

**Limitations:**
- Cannot add new classes or change class hierarchies
- State is preserved, so if you need to reset state, use Hot Restart
- Some changes may require Hot Restart to take effect

### Hot Restart

**Hot Restart** completely resets the state of the app and rebuilds it from scratch.

**When to use:**
- When you've made changes to the class structure
- When you need to reset app state
- When Hot Reload doesn't apply your changes properly
- When you've added new dependencies

**Key differences:**
- Hot Reload: Fast, preserves state, for UI changes
- Hot Restart: Slower, resets state, for structural changes
